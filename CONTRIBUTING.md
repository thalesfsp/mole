## Before opening a Pull Request

1. Make sure your change is covered by a test and all tests are passing (`make test`)
2. Remove linter warnings added by your code (`make lint`)
3. Validate your changes by doing manual tests using the [test enviornment](https://github.com/thalesfsp/mole/blob/master/test-env/README.md)

## Pull Request Process

Once a Pull Request (PR) is created, [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
will automagically take care of validating your changes by building the project
and running the automated tests.
If either the build or the tests fail, the PR will not be merged and it is
expected that you fix the issues until the validation passes.
